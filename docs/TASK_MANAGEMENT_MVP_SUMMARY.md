- `PositionTaskAssignmentService` - Position-based assignment logic
- `TaskInstantiationWorkflowService` - Template instantiation workflow
- `TaskNotificationService` - Notification management

### **Key Features**
- **Position-Based Architecture**: Tasks are assigned to positions, not individuals
- **Automatic Delegation**: Tasks flow through delegation chains automatically
- **Template Library**: Reusable task templates with categories and search
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Instant notifications for task assignments and updates
- **Approval Workflows**: Configurable approval processes for task creation
- **Compliance Tracking**: Built-in compliance and quality requirements

## üöÄ **How It Works**

### **1. Template Creation**
1. Admin creates task templates with categories, requirements, and DoD
2. Templates can be assigned to specific positions or departments
3. Templates include approval workflows and compliance requirements

### **2. Position Assignment**
1. Admin assigns templates to positions with custom settings
2. Assignment modes control when tasks are generated:
   - **Immediate**: Generate tasks right away
   - **On Assignment**: Generate when user is assigned to position
   - **Scheduled**: Generate on specific dates
   - **Conditional**: Generate based on conditions

### **3. Automatic Task Generation**
1. When a user is assigned to a position, the system automatically:
   - Checks for template assignments to that position
   - Generates tasks based on assignment mode
   - Sends notifications to the user
   - Creates tasks with position-specific customizations

### **4. Task Management**
1. Users see their tasks in "My Tasks" dashboard
2. Tasks include Definition of Done requirements
3. Users can update progress and complete tasks
4. System tracks completion and sends notifications

### **5. Notifications & Monitoring**
1. Real-time notifications for:
   - New task assignments
   - Due date reminders
   - Overdue tasks
   - Task completions
   - Approval requirements
2. Automated monitoring of task status and due dates
