# EPIC A — Org & Identity Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of EPIC A — Org & Identity for the Manufacturing Industry PMS. This epic provides a comprehensive organization structure management system with position-based assignments, delegation workflows, and full audit capabilities.

## Goals Achieved ✅

Model org structure (departments ↔ positions ↔ people), keep assignment history, and support delegations that automatically flow through to work within 60s.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Department Management

**Path**: `/org-structure` → Departments Tab

Create and manage organizational departments with:
- Hierarchical structure (parent-child relationships)
- Department codes for easy reference
- Location and cost center tracking
- Budget allocation
- Status management (active/inactive/archived)

**Key Components**:
- `DepartmentManagement.tsx` - Full CRUD UI
- Department list with filtering
- Hierarchical visualization

### 2. Position Management

**Path**: `/org-structure` → Positions Tab

Define positions with comprehensive details:
- Title, code, and description
- Department association
- Organizational level
- Reporting structure (reports-to relationships)
- Required and optional skills
- Certifications required
- Approval authority levels
- Scope definition (departments, locations, processes)
- Employment type and headcount

**Key Components**:
- `PositionManagement.tsx` - Position CRUD with advanced fields
- Skills and certification management
- Approval authority configuration

### 3. Position Assignment & History

**Path**: `/org-structure` → Assignments Tab

Assign people to positions with full history:
- Assign users to positions
- Assignment types: permanent, temporary, acting
- Start and end dates

- Track swap operations in audit log
- View reassignment summary (tasks, projects, approvals)

**Swap Process**:
1. End both current assignments
2. Create new cross-assignments (A→B, B→A)
3. Reassign all open tasks
4. Update project managers
5. Transfer approvals
6. Log in audit trail

**Key Components**:
- `OccupantSwap.tsx` - Swap UI with validation

### 5. Delegations

**Path**: `/org-structure` → Delegations Tab

Time-bounded authority delegations:
- Delegate from one position to another
- Scope types: all, partial, specific
- Time-bounded (must have end date)

- Point-in-time queries (who was in position on specific date)
- Full audit log of all org changes
- Export to CSV for compliance
- Filter by date range, entity type, action

**Report Types**:
1. **Position History**: Complete assignment history for a position
2. **Audit Log**: Detailed change log with before/after values
3. **Compliance Report**: Combined history + audit trail

**Key Components**:
- `AuditReport.tsx` - Report generator with multiple views

### 8. Task Assignment Service

**File**: `lib/task-assignment-service.ts`

Enhanced task assignment with delegation support:

## Testing

### Seed Script
Run the seed script to populate test data:
```bash
cd apps/pms
npm run seed:org
```

This creates:
- 4 departments (3 top-level, 1 sub-department)
- 4 positions (VP, Supervisor, QA Manager, Engineer)
- Hierarchical reporting structure

### Test Scenarios

   - Create Manufacturing dept
   - Create Production Line 1 as child
   - Verify hierarchy display

2. **Position Assignment**
   - Create position
   - Assign user to position
   - Verify previous assignment ended
   - Check assignment history

3. **Occupant Swap**
   - Create 2 positions with users
   - Assign tasks to both positions
   - Execute swap
   - Verify tasks reassigned correctly
   - Check swap took < 60s

4. **Delegation Flow**
   - Create delegation from Position A to B
   - Assign task to Position A
   - Verify task appears for Position B user
   - Revoke delegation
   - Verify task returns to Position A user

5. **Audit Reports**
   - Make multiple org changes
   - Generate position history report
   - Generate audit log report
