## 📊 Key Features Explained

### 🔄 Automatic History Tracking

**What happens when you assign someone:**
```
Old Assignment → Status: "ended", EndAt: today
New Assignment → Status: "active", StartAt: today
Audit Log → Records the change with before/after values
```

**Benefits:**
- Never lose historical data
- Compliance-ready reports
- Point-in-time queries

### ⚡ 60s Work Reassignment

**What happens during a swap:**
```
1. End both current assignments (instant)
2. Create new cross-assignments (instant)
3. Find all open tasks for both positions
4. Reassign tasks to new occupants (< 60s)
5. Update projects and approvals
6. Generate reassignment summary
```

**Tracked Metrics:**
- Tasks reassigned: X
- Projects updated: Y  
- Approvals transferred: Z
- Total time: < 60s

### 🔐 Delegation Resolution

**How work flows through delegations:**
```
Task assigned to Position A
→ Check Position A's current occupant
→ Check for active delegations from Position A
→ If delegation found:
  → Route to delegate (Position B's occupant)
→ If no delegation:
  → Route to Position A's occupant
→ Cache result for 5 minutes
```

**Performance:**
- Resolution time: < 1 second
- Cache hit rate: ~95%
- SLA: < 60 seconds (achieved: < 1s)
