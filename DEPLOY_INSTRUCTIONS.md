## Troubleshooting

**Site name already taken?**
- Try: orgstructure-html-mockups
- Or: girish-orgstructure-mockups
- Or: leave blank for random name like "silly-einstein-123abc"

**Deploy failed?**
- Check internet connection
- Run: `netlify status` to verify login
- Try the drag & drop method instead

**Need to redeploy?**
```bash
cd /Users/Girish/Projects/OrgStructure-TaskMgmt-Platform/mockups
netlify deploy --prod
```
