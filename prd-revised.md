# AI-Powered Organizational Hierarchy Platform
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Version 1.3 | January 2025**

---

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Reduce task assignment and routing time by 97% (from 15 minutes to 30 seconds per task)
- Achieve 100% compliance tracking for regulatory and SOP-driven tasks
- Enable 50% faster project delivery through intelligent resource allocation
- Provide real-time visibility into organizational workflows and bottlenecks
- Support 90% automated task routing with manual override capabilities
- Establish position-based architecture as the foundation for all workflow automation
- Deliver measurable ROI within 90 days of implementation

### Background Context

This PRD defines the requirements for an AI-Powered Organizational Hierarchy Platform that addresses the critical enterprise challenge of workflow inefficiency, which currently costs organizations 40-60% of management time and $62 billion annually in lost productivity. Based on comprehensive research and the Project Brief, we're building a position-based workflow automation system that combines organizational intelligence with template-driven task management.

The platform leverages proven patterns from successful platforms like Monday.com and Notion while introducing innovations in position-based routing, compliance automation, and transparent AI-assisted decision making. By treating organizational structure as living infrastructure rather than static data, the solution enables enterprises to adapt quickly to changing structures while maintaining workflow continuity and compliance.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The platform embodies a "Progressive Disclosure" design philosophy where complexity is revealed gradually as users become more proficient. The interface starts simple with guided workflows and smart defaults, then progressively unlocks advanced features based on usage patterns and user roles. Every interaction should feel intuitive and purposeful, with the system acting as an intelligent assistant that suggests next actions rather than requiring users to hunt for features.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Visual-First Manipulation:** Drag-and-drop for org charts, workflow design, and task prioritization
- **Contextual Intelligence:** Right-click menus and hover cards that anticipate user needs
- **Inline Editing:** Direct manipulation without modal dialogs where possible
- **Progressive Forms:** Multi-step wizards that reveal fields based on previous selections
- **Smart Suggestions:** AI-powered autocomplete and next-best-action recommendations
- **Batch Operations:** Select multiple items for bulk actions with preview before commit
- **Keyboard Power Users:** Complete keyboard navigation and shortcuts for efficiency
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Live cursors, presence indicators, and instant updates
- **Data Virtualization (NEW):** All large-scale data visualizations, particularly the Org Chart Canvas, must use data virtualization. The frontend will only request and render the nodes currently visible in the user's viewport, fetching additional data on pan or zoom

### Core Screens and Views

- **Dashboard Hub:** Personalized command center with role-specific widgets
- **Org Chart Canvas:** Interactive visualization with zoom, pan, search, and edit
- **Workflow Designer:** Visual drag-and-drop workflow builder with live preview
- **Task Command Center:** Unified inbox for all assigned tasks with smart filters
- **Project Portfolio:** Gantt charts, Kanban boards, and resource allocation views
- **Compliance Control Room:** Real-time compliance status with drill-down
- **Analytics Studio:** Custom dashboard builder with 50+ visualization types
- **Template Gallery:** Searchable library of workflow and project templates
- **Admin Console:** System configuration, user management, and audit logs
- **Mobile Experience:** Touch-optimized interface for field workers

### Accessibility

**WCAG AAA:** Full WCAG AAA compliance with screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast modes, adjustable font sizes, color-blind safe palettes, focus indicators, and ARIA labels throughout.

### Branding

- **Design System Foundation:** Material Design 3 principles with enterprise customization
- **Color Palette:** Professional blues/grays with semantic colors for status
- **Typography:** Inter for UI, SF Pro for Apple platforms, Segoe for Windows
- **Motion Design:** Subtle animations (200-300ms) for state changes
- **White-Label Ready:** Complete theming system for enterprise customization
- **Dark Mode:** Full dark theme support with automatic switching

### Target Device and Platforms

**Cross-Platform:**
- **Desktop Web:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- **Tablet:** iPad Pro, Surface, Android tablets - responsive down to 768px
- **Mobile:** iOS 14+ and Android 10+ native apps with offline support
- **Large Displays:** 4K and multi-monitor support for command centers
- **Wearables:** Apple Watch and WearOS for notifications
- **Voice Interfaces:** Alexa for Business and Google Assistant integration

## 4. Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

We will use a monorepo structure initially to accelerate development and maintain consistency across the platform. This allows shared types between frontend and backend, unified CI/CD pipelines, atomic commits across services, and easier refactoring. The structure will be organized by feature modules with clear boundaries to enable future extraction to microservices if needed.

### Service Architecture: Modular Monolith → Microservices

Starting with a modular monolith architecture for faster initial development, with clear module boundaries designed for future extraction. Core modules include: Organization Service, Workflow Engine, Task Manager, Compliance Module, Analytics Engine, and Integration Gateway. Each module will communicate through well-defined interfaces using event-driven patterns.

### Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid

- **Unit Tests:** 80% code coverage minimum using Jest/Vitest
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoint testing with Supertest
- **E2E Tests:** Critical user journeys with Playwright
- **Performance Tests:** Load testing with k6 or JMeter
- **Security Tests:** SAST with SonarQube, DAST with OWASP ZAP
- **Contract Tests:** API contract testing with Pact

### Additional Technical Assumptions

#### Frontend Architecture:
- React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- Next.js 14+ for SSR/SSG and optimal performance
- State management with Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- Component library based on Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- Micro-frontend architecture preparation

#### Backend Architecture:
- Node.js with NestJS framework for enterprise-grade structure
- GraphQL with Apollo Server for flexible client queries
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Redis for caching, sessions, and pub/sub
- Bull/BullMQ for job queues and background processing
- **(NEW)** All bulk operations (e.g., broadcast tasks to a department, large-scale notifications) will be processed asynchronously via the message queue (BullMQ). The initial user request will receive an immediate 'accepted' response to ensure UI responsiveness while the work is processed in the background

#### Data Model (NEW):
The organizational data model shall be temporal, using effective-dating (start and end dates) for all position-person assignments and reporting lines. This ensures that historical workflow audits reflect the organizational structure as it existed at the time of the action.

#### Workflow Engine (NEW):
The workflow execution engine will implement a maximum recursion depth check (e.g., 50 steps) to terminate any runaway processes at runtime, logging a critical error and notifying an administrator.

#### Infrastructure & DevOps:
- Kubernetes orchestration with Helm charts
- GitOps deployment with ArgoCD
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Multi-region deployment with geo-routing
- CDN with CloudFront/Fastly for global performance

#### Security Architecture:
- Zero-trust security model
- OAuth 2.0/OIDC for user authentication
- RBAC with attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Secrets management with HashiCorp Vault
- End-to-end encryption with customer-managed keys
